# stock-data-analysis
Extracting and analyzing historical stock and revenue data using Python libraries like yfinance, BeautifulSoup, and Plotly.

Technologies Used:
yfinance – for downloading stock data
requests & BeautifulSoup – for web scraping revenue data
pandas – for data manipulation
matplotlib – for interactive visualizations
Jupyter Notebook – for developing and documenting the analysis

Key Companies Analyzed:
Tesla (TSLA)
GameStop (GME)
Amazon (AMZN)

Run the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code to explore the data.

Note on Graph Output
To ensure the graphs render correctly in the uploaded .ipynb on GitHub, this notebook uses Matplotlib instead of Plotly.
This change was made because:
Plotly requires the Kaleido engine for exporting static images, which can cause errors if not installed.
Plotly graphs sometimes do not render well in GitHub previews.
Matplotlib ensures that all outputs are visible in a single screenshot or directly in the notebook file.
